# Jenkins Shared Library and Parameterized Pipeline with Docker, Git, ECR, and EKS Deployment ðŸš€ðŸ”§ðŸ˜ƒ

## Introduction
This README provides a comprehensive guide on how Jenkins Shared Library, Parameterized Pipeline, Docker, Git, ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry), and EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) were used together for deployment. We will cover the setup, configuration, and deployment process, with the added fun of emojis! Let's dive into more detail about each component of our deployment workflow. ðŸŽ‰

## Step 1: Jenkins Shared Library
Jenkins Shared Library is a powerful feature that allows us to define common functions, utilities, and custom steps to be used across multiple Jenkins pipelines. With a shared library, we encapsulate the pipeline logic, making it easier to maintain, update, and share best practices among various projects and teams.

To set up the Jenkins Shared Library, we followed these steps:
1. We created a separate Git repository to host the shared library code.
2. Inside the repository, we organized the code into the appropriate directory structure.
3. The Jenkins master was configured to recognize and load the shared library from the Git repository.
4. We defined custom steps like `buildDockerImage()`, `deployToEKS()`, and utility functions for logging and error handling.

This approach significantly streamlined our pipeline creation process. Rather than repeating code across pipelines, we can now call these shared library functions, reducing redundancy and promoting consistency.

## Step 2: Parameterized Pipeline
Our Jenkins pipeline is parameterized to provide flexibility during the deployment process. Parameterizing the pipeline allows us to customize its behavior based on different use cases and deployment environments. Key parameters in our pipeline include:

1. **Application Version**: This parameter allows developers to specify the version of the application to be deployed. It ensures that we are deploying the correct version consistently across environments.

2. **Deployment Environment**: The pipeline prompts the developer to select the target environment for deployment. We typically offer options like `staging` and `production`. This ensures that the pipeline can be reused for multiple environments, maintaining consistency across different stages of development.

3. **Configuration Parameters**: Depending on the application's requirements, we can also include additional parameters to customize its deployment behavior. These could include things like database connection strings, API endpoints, or other environment-specific settings.

## Step 3: Docker Integration
Docker plays a central role in our deployment workflow. Containerizing our application with Docker provides a consistent and portable environment, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensuring that the application runs the same way on different systems.

Here's how we integrated Docker into our deployment process:
1. **Dockerfile**: We created a Dockerfile that defines the application's runtime environment and dependencies. The Dockerfile serves as a blueprint for building a Docker image of our application.

2. **Building the Docker Image**: During the Jenkins pipeline execution, we utilize Docker to build the container image based on the instructions provided in the Dockerfile. The built image is then ready for deployment.

3. **Container Registry**: To maintain a centralized repository of our container images, we leverage Amazon ECR. Once the Docker image is successfully built, Jenkins securely logs in to the ECR registry and pushes the image, making it available for deployment to Amazon EKS.

## Step 4: Git Integration
Git integration with Jenkins is essential for automating the deployment process. We configured Jenkins to monitor the selected Git repository for changes continuously. Whenever new changes are pushed to the specified branch (e.g., `develop`), Jenkins triggers the pipeline automatically, initiating the deployment process.

By linking the pipeline to the repository, we ensure that deployments are always based on the latest code version. This integration streamlines the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process, allowing us to deliver updates more frequently and reliably.

## Step 5: Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
Amazon ECR serves as our secure and scalable container image registry. We use it to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

Here's how we set up ECR integration:
1. **Create ECR Repository**: For each application or service, we create a dedicated ECR repository to store its container images. The repository acts as a centralized location to hold versions of the application.

2. **ECR Authentication**: Jenkins is configured with the appropriate credentials to securely log in to the ECR registry. This ensures that the Docker image can be pushed to the ECR repository without any authentication issues.

3. **Push Docker Image to ECR**: Once the Docker image is built, Jenkins pushes it to the corresponding ECR repository using the provided version tag. This allows us to track and manage different versions of the application easily.

## Step 6: Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) Deployment
Amazon EKS is our chosen platform for Kubernetes-based container orchestration. Kubernetes helps manage and scale our containerized applications efficiently.

The deployment to Amazon EKS involves the following steps:
1. **Kubernetes Configuration**: We maintain Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files in our Git repository. These files define the desired state of our application, including the number of replicas, resource requests, and any other configuration details.

2. **Apply Kubernetes Configuration**: As part of the Jenkins pipeline, we use the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) to apply the changes defined in the Kubernetes YAML files. This action triggers the deployment and scaling of the application on the EKS cluster.

3. **Rolling Updates**: Kubernetes ensures seamless updates by using rolling updates. This means that the new version of the application is gradually rolled out while maintaining the desired number of replicas. If any issues occur, Kubernetes automatically rolls back to the previous version, ensuring high availability.

4. **Monitoring and Auto-scaling**: EKS provides built-in monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities, ensuring that our application scales automatically based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance.

## Deployment Process ðŸš€

1. Developer pushes changes to the Git repository (e.g., `develop` branch).
2. Jenkins detects the new changes and automatically triggers the deployment pipeline.
3. The Parameterized Pipeline prompts the developer to select the deployment environment and provide the application version.
4. Jenkins Shared Library provides reusable functions and steps for various deployment tasks.
5. The pipeline starts building the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
6. The built image is tagged with the provided application version.
7. Jenkins securely logs in to the Amazon ECR registry and pushes the Docker image to it.
8. The pipeline communicates with Amazon EKS to deploy the updated container image to the selected environment (staging or production).
9. Kubernetes applies the configuration changes, deploying the application with rolling updates to ensure high availability.
10. Post-deployment tests and checks are performed to ensure the application is running correctly and verify that auto-scaling is functioning as expected.
11. ðŸŽ‰ The application is successfully deployed, and everyone celebrates with emojis! ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰

## Conclusion
By utilizing Jenkins Shared Library, Parameterized Pipeline, Docker, Git, Amazon ECR, and Amazon EKS, we have built a robust and scalable deployment workflow. This setup allows us to deliver updates efficiently, maintain consistency across environments, and promote collaboration among development teams. Embracing these modern technologies and practices ensures that our deployments are smooth, reliable, and delightful for both developers and end-users. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’»ðŸ˜ƒ
